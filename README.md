# Meme-Generator

Create and share fun memes! Create a meme with your own text or create your own individual memes!

## Implementation

For the purpose of building this project, I've chosen to use ReactJS. The reason for choosing React was, because it was very easy to build a "SPA" with only view like in my case. Also I have a lot of experience with vanilla JavaScript and React as a JavaScript framework. This choose was very naturally and it was quite fun to build something like this application.

## Used 3rd party libraries

  1. SCSS - I've chosen to use SCSS, because is very easy to have a lot of nested CSS classes and properties. Also it saves a lot of lines of code, which is time saver     in some cases. Other reason for this usage was that, I had already some experience with it and felt enough confident in my skills.
  2. React Icons - This 3rd party library was necessary, because I used to add some icons in the main view.
  3. html2canvas - This library is used in this case, because it gives the opportunity to download the meme with texts over the image and use font-family with chosen       font-size from the user.
